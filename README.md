## Overview of data_processing.R
  This script serves the purpose to read in data from an excel document that was
  taken from my wife's STRAVA account and then tidy it to be more readable and 
  malleable. It then, also, creates a second, smaller table showing some simple
  analyzing of the data to set the rest of the project up for full analyzing and
  visualization.
  
### Repository structure
  The repository contains three folders:
    data:
      raw - contains the .xslx file as downloaded from Google forms.
      processed - contains the cleaned up version of my data
    scripts:
      01_processing - contains a single script that reads the raw data and cleans it up
      02_analyses -
      03_contents -
    results:
      contains a folder where saved images will go
